# Maze Visualization Using Backtracking

This project is a maze visualization application built using Python and Pygame. It generates and visualizes mazes using a backtracking algorithm, allowing users to observe the maze generation process in real-time.

## Project Structure

```
Maze_visualization_Backtracking
│── main.py             # Entry point for the maze visualization application
│── maze.py             # Core logic for generating and visualizing the maze
│── utils.py            # Utility functions supporting the maze logic
├── requirements.txt      # Dependencies required for the project
└── README.md             # Documentation for the project
```

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maze-visualization-optimizer.git
   cd Maze_visualization_Backtracking
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To start the maze visualization application, run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

This will initialize the Pygame library, set up the display, and begin the maze visualization process.
